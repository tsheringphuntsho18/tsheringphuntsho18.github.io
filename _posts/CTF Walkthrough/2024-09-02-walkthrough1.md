# Topic : Finals Journal

In this project, we embarked on developing a full-stack web application that models a popular digital service marketplace(Website for Auction place). The aim was to create a platform similar to eBay, Craigslist, or Etsy, incorporating essential features such as pagination, user authentication and authorization, RESTful API endpoints, and real-time data communication using WebSockets. This journal documents the journey, including the development process, challenges encountered, and how we addressed them as a group and individual by doing out parts in the project.
