### Topic : Entity Relationship Diagram

In this flipped class 2 I learned about ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram). ERD represents the overall logical structure of a database. The component of an ERD are entity, attribute and relationship. 

Entity can be either a living oe non-living component and it is illustrated with an rectangle shape. For example both the student and the programme are entities.

An attributes are discriptive properties possessed by each entity.
