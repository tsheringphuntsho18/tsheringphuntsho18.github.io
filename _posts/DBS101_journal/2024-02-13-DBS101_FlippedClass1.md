### Topic : Database Users and Database Administrators

In this flipped class I learned about who were database users and what is the roles and responsibilities of database administrators. Under the database users, I learned about 7 types of database users in DBMS. 
1 Database administrator
2 Naive users
3 System analyst
4 Sophisticated users
5 Database designers
6 Application programmers
7 Casual users / Temporary user.

A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system and a database administrator is an IT professional role within a Computer System Administration. The roles and responsibilities of database administrator is to create and maintain a secure database and they also have to ensure that the database is safe and  data is protected from unauthorized access. They create backup and recovery plans to prevent data loss in disasters or attacks.

During a flipped class, our tutor divide us into home group and given a topic to discuss. My group got roles and responsibilities of database administrator. After the discussion we were divided into expert group where each of us has to share our point on our topic. The flipped class ended with a question and answer session with the tutor.

Flipped class was every interesting so i didn't found any field of improvement.
