## Topic: Hack The Box : Starting Point

### Introduction
Hack The Box is the hacking playground and cybersecurity community in the world founded by Haris Pylarinos. Its Starting Point machines serve as an excellent entry point for beginners which makes us understand the basics of penetration testing. I am a beginner to cyber security and chose to start from the starting point machine. Starting points consist of 3 tier(tier0, tier1 and tier 2),  in this journal i will be going  through tier0 and tier1. Note that to answer the challenges under each tier, we need to connect to the hack the box VPN.

### TIER 0 (The key is a strong foundation)
From tier 0, I have gained essential skills in pen-testing. I learned how to connect to various services, such as ftp, smb and telnet  anonymously. I also learned how to use nmap to identify open ports. In this tier there are many virtual machines but some are locked and can only be answered by purchasing premium. So the virtual machines that I will be going through in this tier are Meow, Fawn, Dancing and Redeemer.

#### 1. Meow
Task 1

Task 2

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb2.png)

Task 3

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb3.png)

As mentioned above, we need to form a VPN connection into HTB labs. To do so we need to use the openvpn service followed by /path/to VPN that we downloaded from hack the box.

Command :
 sudo openvpn /home/tshering/Downloads/starting_point_emptyboxInside.ovpn

Task 4: What tool do we use to test our connection to the target with an ICMP echo request?

Ans: ping

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb4.png)

Task 5

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb5.png)

Task 6: What service do we identify on port 23/tcp during our scans?

Ans: telnet

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb6.png)

After scanning, on port 23/tcp I identify a telnet service . TELNET (TErminaL NETwork) is a type of protocol that enables one computer to connect to a local computer.

Task 7

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb7.png)

Task 8: Summit root flag

To CTF(capture the flag), I need to connect with the target machine IP address.

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb8.png)

Root is the username that I can login with password.
With the ‚Äúls‚Äù command, all the files and folders inside that directory will be displayed.

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb8a.png)

There is a flag.txt file, so to display the content inside that file the command is ‚Äúcat‚Äù

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htb8c.png)

Flag is b40abdfe23665f766f9c61ecba8a4c19


#### 2. Fawn

Ans: 230

Task 10

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbf10.png)

Task 11

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbf11.png)

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbfflag.png)

I listed the files and folders inside ftp and found that there is a flag.txt file but I can't display that file with the ‚Äòcat‚Äô command, so as mentioned in the previous task, I can download it with the ‚Äòget‚Äô command. 

Flag is 035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815

With the help command we can get all the applicable commands. I saw the ‚Äòget‚Äô command which is to download the files.

Task 8: Submit root flag

We can login to workshares as it doesn't require a password, so i login to workshare.
 
 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbd8a.png)

After connecting to the workshares i found 2 folders so I checked them one by one. Inside the Amy.J folder there is a worknotes.txt which contains the text shown below:

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbdb.png)

Then I opened the James.P folder, inside the James.p folder there is a flag.txt file so I downloaded it and got the flag.

### TIER 1 (You need to walk before you can run)
Tier 1 is going deeper into the world of cybersecurity pen-testing, focusing on web exploitation techniques. I learn basic web exploitation techniques such as SQL injection and  server side template Injection. Building on the knowledge from tier 0, I have applied these techniques to exploit various services showcased earlier, ensuring a hands-on understanding of their vulnerabilities.So the virtual machines that I will be going through in this tier are Appointment, Sequel, Crocodile and Responder.

#### 1. Appointment
Task 1

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap1.png)

SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases

Task 2

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap2.png)

SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve.

Task 3

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap3.png)

Task 4: What does Nmap report as the service and version that are running on port 80 of the target?

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap4.png)

Ans: Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))

Task 5: What is the standard port used for the HTTPS protocol?

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap5.png)

Ans: 443

Task 6

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap6.png)

Folders are also called "directories,"

Task 7

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap7.png)

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed.

Task 8

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap8.png)

Task 9

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap9.png)

Task 10: If user input is not handled carefully, it could be interpreted as a comment. Use a comment to login as admin without knowing the password. What is the first word on the web page returned?

I pasted the machine ip address on the website and got this.

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap10a.png)

Now to login i need username name and password which i don't know but i can use sql injection to login. In this case, I can log in as any user without the need for a password by using the SQL comment(#). 

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap10b.png)

After # anything I type in the password section will be ignored. Then I will successfully login.

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbap10c.png)

Ans for task 10: Congratulations

Flag is e3d0796d002a446c0e622226f42e9672

Then I visualized the database and found four databases, among them the htb database is unique to this host.

![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbs7b.png)

Ans: htb

To CTF, I have to use the htb database.

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbs7c.png)

After that I want to see what tables are there inside the htb database. There are two tables, config and user.

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbs7d.png)

Next I went through each table, and got a flag in the config table.

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbs7e.png)

Flag is 7b4bec00d1a39e3dd4e021ec3d915da8

#### 3. Crocodile

With the help function we can find the available command, in ftp there is ‚Äòget‚Äô command to download the file.

Task 6: What is one of the higher-privilege sounding usernames in 'allowed.userlist' that we download from the FTP server?

First I listed the files and folders inside ftp and found that allowed.userlist is there and I downloaded it .

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbc6a.png)

When I opened the allowed.userlist file I found that admin has a higher-privilege.

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbc6b.png)

Ans: admin

Task 7: What version of Apache HTTP Server is running on the target host?

 ![htb](/pictures/SWS_pictures/htbc2n7.png)

### Conclusion
Going through each machine, I have learned something new about pen testing and got real world hacking experiences. I make good use of google when i am stuck, and i say googling is also a part of software engineering skills. So lastly I quote‚ÄùMy crime is that of curiosity‚Äù.
